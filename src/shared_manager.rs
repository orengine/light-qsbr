/// A shared manager that coordinates memory reclamation across executors.
///
/// The [`SharedManager`] is the central structure that keeps a number of registered executors,
/// a number of executors that passed the current epoch, and the current epoch number.
///
/// Executors register themselves with the [`SharedManager`] and get
/// a thread-local [`LocalManager`], which they use to schedule memory for deallocation or dropping.
///
/// The [`SharedManager`] ensures that memory is only freed when it is safe â€” that is,
/// once all executors have advanced past the epoch in which the memory was retired.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// 1. Create a new [`SharedManager`] with [`SharedManager::new`].
/// 2. For each executor (thread or runtime worker), call
///    [`SharedManager::register_new_executor`] to install a thread-local [`LocalManager`].
/// 3. Executors periodically call [`LocalManager::maybe_pass_epoch`] to advance epochs
///    and allow reclamation.
/// 4. When an executor is done, it must deregister with
///    `unsafe { LocalManager::deregister() }`.
///
/// # Example
///
/// You can find a very detailed example in the [`LocalManager`]'s docs.
